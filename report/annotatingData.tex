In order to classify clusters we created an annotation-tool that uses the sessions and clusters can create. The tool provides an overview of relevant information about the cluster and stores this with the classification, provided by the user, so that it is usable in a learning algorithm. A user guide to the tool can be found here \footnote{\url{http://achtbits.googlecode.com/files/User_Guide-Annotation_Tool-AchtBits.pdf}}.
