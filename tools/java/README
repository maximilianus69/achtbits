PreprocessCsvFiles
    Parses a gps raw data file (and optionally an accelerometer raw data file). Excludes
        NULL values, data above land and the Wadden Sea and creates session files. 
        The labels of each column are saved in the output directory in a file called 
        "labels.txt".

    Command line argument #0: gps .csv file.
    Command line argument #1: directory in which to create a folder with the session files
        (optional) Command line argument #2: accelerometer .csv file.

    One can configure config.txt to change parameters if one does not wish to see
        the Java souce code. The values of each line after the '=' are linked to
        variables. So do not change the order of the lines. One can write before the 
        '=' whatever one wants. 

Wrapper 
    Checks a directory for raw gps files with the name "DATA_ALL_GPS_BIRD_X.csv and
        accelerometer data files with the name "DATA_ALL_ACCELEROMETER_BIRD_X.csv (with
        X being the device ID). After this it uses PreprocessCsvFiles to output session
        files. 

    Command line argument #0: output directory in which to create folders with the session
        files.
    Command line argument #1: the input directory of the data files.
